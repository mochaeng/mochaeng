# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luiz Campos (**@MochaEng**). I'm currently an undergrad speaking Portuguese and English. I have experience with _machine learning_ and _federated learning_. I also have background in web-dev, including backends with Go and frontends with React).

I like puzzles, music, philosophy, and learning new things every day.

```ocaml
let () = IO.print_line $"Hello, I am Luiz!"
```
