### Hi there 👋


I'm currently an undergraduate student interested in anything **Distributed Systems** and **Computer Networks** related. I'm also researching/working on my final project on the topic of Federated Learning. 

I like free software, and in my free time, I enjoy messing with linux 🐧, writing configuration files to customize stuff 🎨, and doing some game dev with Godot 🎮.

- ✏️ Languages: Go, Python, Java, TypeScript.
- 💻 Tech: Docker, Linux, Godot.

Check out some of my projects below! 😊
